My first discord bot, expect bugs
Add the bot here: https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1452672757002277028&permissions=8&integration_type=0&scope=bot
The bot has many commands(random ones included)
All the commands use ! before the command text
"!hello" makes the bot say hello and introduce its name
"!hello2" makes the bot send a Hello GIF
"!ping" makes the bot say pong
"!memes" makes the bot send a random meme(though it's in portuguese since im br)
"!heh" (int) makes the bot say "he" for the amount of times the user says
"!pokerandom" makes the bot send a random image of a pokemon
